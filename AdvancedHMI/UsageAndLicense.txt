AdvancedHMI is released as open source solution under the GPL License. AdvancedHMI's growth
relies on continued distribution. As the user base grows so does the support and features.
The GPL distriution model is intended to benefit us all.

In order to avoid the need to comb through vast amounts of legal jargon,
the following is a quick summary on using the software.

1) You can use AdvancedHMI to build HMIs for in house machinery or machinery you sell
2) It is an open source project and must remain that way, which means if you build an
   HMI and sell the machine, the customer has the right to ALL of the source code just
   as much as you did. If you need to distribute under a closed source license, you may
   contact us about purchasing a license.
3) The graphics are copyrighted and only to be associated with AdvancedHMI.
4) You can NOT use AdvancedHMI to develop your own HMI development software and sell
   it under another name (re-branding)
5) AdvancedHMI must be distributed in full. You cannot remove parts or use pieces in another project
6) The included DLLs can be freely redistributed with HMI applications. NOTE: These files are not
   released under a GPL license.


If you wish to use AdvancedHMI outside of those basic rules, then you may contact us
and see if we can come up with a written agreement.

Something heavily frowned upon is trying to keep the source code from the customer. If anyone
has ever worked in a plant and must maintain machinery software, they know there is
nothing more irritating then a locked out PLC and HMI that will not allow you to make
something as simple as a quick change.

The recommended practice is to create a directory named "source" on the target PC and copy
the complete VB project in that directory, then create a shortcut to the executable file
found in the \bin directory.
